# Slytherin-Game-using-Genetic-Algorithm

## AIM
Snake game have been around from the time when people started using mobile phones. People enjoyed playing it since the controls were only the four directional keys and the only objective was to collect the fruit to grow the snake’s length without colliding the snake's head with its body. Reinforcement learning though around from some time has started to find its application in tasks which try to computer to perform human capabilities. I thought the snake game would help us learn how to use reinforcement learning concepts and make the computer play the game by itself and try to beat a normal human score.

## SCOPE 
The scope of this project is to investigate the powers residing within genetic algorithms that can on its own solve complex problems. From simple games such as snake or tic-tac-toe to many complex applications like self-driving cars or AI-driven robots, genetic algorithms have the ability to reproduce human-like results or even better. It can work wonders with many problems  because it does not require any type  of training dataset, just a set of rules can help us solve the problem over a number of iterations. To implement the project it is essential to know the in’s and out’s of python through which we will code.
